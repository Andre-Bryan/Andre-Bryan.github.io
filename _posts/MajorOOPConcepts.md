A programming paradigm that is very common is called Object Oriented Programming. Much like the name implies this paradigm is based around what is called "objects". These objects hold data which I refer to as attributes and code which I call methods. So instead of the traditional progamming concept which revolves around actions and data, Object Oriented Programming revolves around objects. This shifts the focus of how to do something with full on logic to how can we manipulate the attributes and methods of the object to complete our task. Object Oriented Programming is not an easy concept to grasp wbut after messing around with it and getting hands on practice it is not that bad. When it comes to Object Oriented Programming(OOP) there are 4 major concepts:Encapsulation, Abstraction,Polymorphism, and Inheritance.
# Encapsulation

```
hello world

This is a text snippet

## Abstraction

### Polymorphism


#### Inheritance
Inheritance is
'''
class MountainBike extends Bicycle {

    // new fields and methods defining 
    // a mountain bike would go here

}
'''
